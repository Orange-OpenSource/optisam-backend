When a product is used on different equipments on a same network with different versions, we can create an aggregation with this set of products if a same license covers all this versions. Application Applications are software entities where are installed the products. Acquired Rights Acquired rights represent all licensing rights owned by a scope. Those rights must be able to cover all products owned by this scope. Counterfeiting Non compliance regarding licensing usage. Situation where less products rights than required have been acquired. Compliance Conformity regarding the licensing usage (compliant, non compliant). Data file In OpTISAM, a data file corresponds to a file that we will import in OpTISAM and which is containing a set of data. These data must, to be considered as valid data, be mapped with a data type define in metadatafile. Group Group enables access to one or more scopes. Group in Optisam context is logical grouping of 2 or more scopes. Each user belong to one or more groups. Group provides mechanism to have a user linked with multiple scopes. A user can see the park linked to all the scopes of its groups. Instance An instance is an instance of an application. An application can have multiple instances running. All instances together form the application. Instances can be deployed on the fly. Editor Software editor. Equipment An equipment is a part of the park where products are installed. A physical or virtual machine on which are installed some products. All equipments in OpTISAM are link together thanks to a hierarchy (father/son). Equipment Types Each virtual or physical equipment belongs to a type (or category). The type of an equipment defines its attributes and places in equipment hierarchy. Equipment types are customizable in OpTISAM (with metadata files). For example, some equipment types can be (from father to child) : datacenter, vcenter, cluster, server, partition. License Official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit). A license is granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. Metadata file In OpTISAM, a metadata file corresponds to a file that will import to OpTISAM and that allows to define the structure of an equipment type. Metric A metric is a unit of measurement used to count the number of licenses necessary for a given use for a given product. Obsolescence The risk of obsolescence corresponds, for a metric, to the impact rate on a scope if a product's license expires. Underusage Situation where an entity has bought more licenses than required to be compliant. Product Usage Right Licensing provides options and flexibility, called PUR. PUR are (not exhaustive) : customer\u2019s use rights, rights to use other versions, applicable use rights, disaster recovery rights, permitted periods of use, conditions on use, required used of some product, metric. (Anne-Lucie Cosse, Thesis) SAM Software asset management (SAM) is a business practice that involves managing and optimizing the purchase, deployment, maintenance, utilization, and disposal of software applications within an organization. According to ITIL, SAM is defined as \u201c[\u2026] all of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control, and protection of the software assets [\u2026] throughout all stages of their lifecycle.\u201d Scope Scopes are used to identify different customers of OpTISAM. It provides a way to isolate data from different customers. Currently isolation is only at application layer, but same can be extended to Database layer if required(sharding/partitioning etc). We will stick to 3 letter codes for scope. Scope Naming Conventions : - For countries : O + 2 digit country ISO code eg. OFR, OSP etc - For Business Units : OCB, TGI Most the modules of OpTISAM are scope aware and require user to provide scope while creating the types of those modules. SKU Stands for \u201cStock Keeping Unit\u201d. SKU is a not normalized code defined by the software editor. It can be found very often in product catalogues/purchase orders during purchasing phase. SWIDTAG Stands for SoftWare IDentification TAG. SWIDtags record unique information about an installed software application, including its name, edition, version, whether it\u2019s part of a bundle and more. SWIDtags support software inventory and asset management initiatives. Software entitlement tags will specify how license consumption measurement can be automated.

Then you have to create a CSV file with all of the attributes. Let's take an example : In this screenshot, you can see the metadata_server.csv with all of the attributes : - server_code [...] server_coresNumber : Attributes of the server - parent_id : The id that will be mapped to the parent of server (here \"cluster\") This metadata files must be CSV with \";\" separator, a \"UTF-8\" encoding and no spaces or special characters. Example : - You can download all the metadata files for the generic template here as an exemple In the case of these files the cluster is the parent of the server for example. Import the metadata file(s) You have to import a CSV metadata file that contains all the attributes of your new equipment including including the foreign key refering to the primary key of his parent if it has one (e.g : in the metadata file of \"servers\", there must be an attribute \"cluster_code\" refering to the cluster that contains the \"server\"). An equipment type can only have ONE and only ONE parent. In order to do this, go to \"Data Management\" and \"Metadata\" : Click on \"Upload Files\" : Click on the \"Browse\" button and select the CSV metadata file(s) (you can upload multiple files at the same time). Click on \"Submit\" when you have selected all the files that you want to upload.

OpTISAM uses the information you'll provide to compute the compliance. For OpTISAM, each product version is identified by a SWIDTag. For this SWIDTag, you have acquired licenses. The contract you passed with the software provider is materialized by a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit). A SKU in OpTISAM refers to a specific package you bought. For that package, you negociated the metrics, the price of the license and even the maintenance. OpTISAM needs to know for each product, the list of SKUs and the specificities related to those SKUs (metrics, prices, maintenance, number of licenses acquired...). Acquired rights An acquired right is something that defines how much licenses you have aquired for a product / metric pair . It is identified by a SKU . SKU The SKU is the identifier of the acquired right. Each product has one or more SKU associated. This SKU is associated to the SWIDTag of a product, to a metric and to a number of licenses acquired . Metrics OpTISAM has predefined metrics and allows you to customize metrics for your products. Each acquired right has its own metric which can be a standard one : \"count the number of instances installed on a server\", or a specific one, like the Oracle processor metric. This metric will be used to compute the compliance. Let's take an example : the formal definition of \"processor metric\" from Oracle . Oracle - Processor metric (Formal definition) In order to compute the compliance with this metric, you have to know the number of processors (each chip if this is a multi-chip processor) of the equipment on which the Oracle program is running. When you know this number you will have to multiply it by the core factor (a number defined by Oracle) associated to this processor (all fractions of a number are to be rounded up to the next whole number). This will give you the number of licences you have to acquire in order to be compliant for this product . Example : I have a server with a processor named \" Sparc T5 \" with 16 chips , if I check in the Oracle core factor table ( here ), I can see that the core factor for my processor is 0.5 . So the number of licenses I have to own for this server to be compliant is 8 ( 16*0.5=8 ). Compliance OpTISAM is computing the compliance of your park with the following elements : - Your park inventory : equipements and products installed on the equipments - The number of licenses that you acquired for the products - The metric that you defined for the product To compute the compliance, OpTISAM is applying, for each product, the metric formula that you defined to your park inventory and computes the number of licenses that your park is using. The compliance is the result of the difference between the number of licenses actually used and the number of licences that you acquired as follow : - If the number of licenses acquired is equal, you are compliant - If the number of licenses acquired is superior, you are compliant but in underusage - If the number of licenses aquired is inferior, you aren't compliant so you are counterfeiting. In this case, you can be fined if you are audited.","title":"How is OpTISAM computing compliance"},{"location":"pages/presentation/computCompliance/#how-is-optisam-computing-compliance","text":"OpTISAM uses the information you'll provide to compute the compliance.
